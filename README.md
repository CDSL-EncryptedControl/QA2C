# QA2C
QA2C provides the drive code for encrypted control for the Quanser Aero 2 model.
The code transforms dynamic controllers through various methods and then drives the system through homomorphic encryption.
The cryptographic libraries for computational homomorphic use [OpenFHE-python](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-python) and [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL).
The code use Quanser's Aero 2 model [Aero 2](https://github.com/quanser/Quanser_Academic_Resources/tree/dev-windows) Python API. 
**Share implementation concept with [QQS3C](https://github.com/RFA0608/QQS3C)**

--- 

## Implementation direction
The code was implemented through data communication with the Quanser API via TCP/IP in order to use openFHE-python that can be run in a Linux environment(**v15 release later version doesn't work, please use v14 release version of openfhe-python**), since the Quanser hardware API is provided only for Python and runs in a Windows environment. 

``` mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Windows_Host [Windows Host: Plant]
        A[Quanser Hardware / QLab] <--> B[Python API / C++ SDK]
        B <--> C{TCP Server}
    end

    subgraph WSL_Guest [WSL / Remote: Controller]
        D{TCP Client} <--> E[Encrypted Controller]
        E --- F[SEAL / OpenFHE / Lattigo]
    end

    C <--> |TCP/IP| D
```

## Features
The code implements controller versions in Python.
The interfacing code for the Python simulator and the actual hardware, corresponding to each controller, can be found in the "interface/plant" directory.
The actual device consists of a single file, "plant.py" in "interface/plant/py/hardware".

### Controller description
This code Just simple example of encrypted controller with full state feedback, observer with parametric reference, integral control(transformd arx also include).

**Controller Compatibility**

| Model | Language | Encryption | Security (128-bit) | Status | Python Series | Other Series |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **full_state_feedback** | Python | BGV (OpenFHE-python) | ◎ | Available | nominal, quantized(_q), encrpyted(_enc) | Ⅹ |
| **observer_form(with parametric)** | Python | - | Ⅹ | Available (without q and enc) | nominal | Ⅹ | 
| **integral_control(with arx)** | Python/C++ | BGV (SEAL) | ◎ | Available | nominal, arx, arx(_q) | encrypted_arx(_enc) |

## How to use
It explains the preparations before use, how to use the Ouanser Interactive Labs, and how to use the actual hardware.
You can follow same instructions [QQS3C](https://github.com/RFA0608/QQS3C).
